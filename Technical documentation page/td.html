           <p> To be very efficient, there are few things you need to set-up, for you to be ready for your journey in Tech.
        </p>
        <p>Below are list of things you need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A computer. </li>
          <li> Access to Internet.</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Next, download and install a code editor from your browser. We highly recommend the Vscode editor, along in it the various extensions</p>

        <p> An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The most commonly used version is HTML 4.01, which became official standard in December 1999.[1] An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.</p>

        <header>HTML Syntax</header>
        <p>In the HTML syntax, most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag, with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed of the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the  element, would be written as:</p>
        <code></code>
        <ul>
          <li>The Normal Element</li>
          <li> Void Element</li>
          <li> Raw Text Element</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
       <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_Element">
        <header>Types of Element</header>
        <p><strong>Normal elements</strong> usually have both a start tag and an end tag, although for some elements the end tag, or both tags, can be omitted. It is constructed in a similar way.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a start tag (<tag>) marking the beginning of an element, which may incorporate any number of HTML attributes;
          </li>
          <li>an end tag, in which the element name is prefixed with a slash: </tag></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Raw text elements</strong> (also known as text or text-only elements) are constructed with</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a start tag (in the form <tag>) marking the beginning of an element, which may incorporate any number of HTML attributes
          </li>
          <li>
            some amount of text content, but no elements (all tags, apart from the applicable end tag, will be interpreted as content);
          </li>
          <li>
            an end tag, in which the element name is prefixed with a slash:() </tag>. In some versions of HTML, the end tag is optional for some elements. The end tag is required in XHTML.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example is the () element, which must not contain other elements (including markup of text), only plain text.</p>
        <p><strong>Void Element</strong> (also sometimes called empty elements, single elements or stand-alone elements) only have a start tag (in the form <code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;<var style="padding-right: 1px;">tag</var>&gt;</code>), which contains any HTML attributes. They may not contain any children, such as text or other elements. For compatibility with XHTML, the HTML specification[which?] allows an optional space and slash[citation needed] (<code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;<var style="padding-right: 1px;">tag</var> /&gt;</code> is permissible). The slash is required in XHTML and other XML applications. Two common void elements are <code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;br /&gt;</code> (for a hard line-break, such as in a poem or an address) and <code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;hr /&gt;</code> (for a thematic break). Other such elements are often place-holders which reference external files, such as the image (<code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;img /&gt;</code>) element. The attributes included in the element will then point to the external file in question. Another example of a void element is <code class="nowrap" style="">&lt;link /&gt;</code>, for which the syntax is: <pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"fancy.css"</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></p>
