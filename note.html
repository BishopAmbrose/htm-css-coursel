HTML TABLE ELEMENT:
HTML tables use the caption element to describe what the table is about. 
The caption element should always be the first child of a table, but can
 be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.

 The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header,
  and which portion contains the primary data or content

  The tr element is used to indicate a table row. Add a tr element within your thead element.
   In your new tr element, add a td element, followed by three th elements.

  The td element indicates a data cell, while the th element indicates a header cell.

THE TABLE STARTS WITH A CAPTION, LIKE NAME OF THE TABLE.
THIS IS PRECEDED BY A <THEad></THEad> AND A <TBody></TBody> ELEMENT.
THE <THEad></THEad> THEN HOUSES THE <TR></TR> ELEMENT FOR THE HEADING.
A <td></td> element and 3 <th></th> element is then nested in the <tr></tr> element.
the td should be left empty, but the <th></th> is given a value whichis nexted within a span with a class set to sr-only.(sr= screen reader).

the <tbody></tbody> comes next. this comprises of the various data, all nested in a <tr></tr> element.
1 <th></th> and the various <td></td> are nested in the <tr></tr>. the <td></td> stands for the data to be inputed.
each <tr></tr> is giving a class set to data, while the last <tr></tr> a class set to total, the <th></th> a class set to description, and the last <td></td> a class set to current
